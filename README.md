In this project, titled "The SIS model and its generalisations" I focused on Deterministic virus spreading, as known as compartmental models for epidemics.

Firstly, I studied the simplest models that corresponds to
- single societies and
- constant population.

These are the so-called SIS (only susceptible people and infected people compartments are present) and the SIR models (there are a third compartment for the recovered).
After that, as a generalization I examined models with non-constant population (SIRD model with a deceased compartment).
Further generalization is the introduction of multiple societies that are coupled to each other (coupled SIS, coupled SIRD).
